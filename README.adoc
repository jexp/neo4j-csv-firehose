# neo4j-csv-firehose

image::https://travis-ci.org/sarmbruster/neo4j-csv-firehose.svg?branch=master[[Travis CI status]

neo4j-csv-firehose enables Neo4j's `LOAD CSV` Cypher command to load other from other datasources as well. It provides a Neo4j unmanaged extension doing on-the-fly conversion of the other datasource to csv - and can therefore act as input for `LOAD CSV`. Alternatively it can be run as standalone server.

## Installation

This project uses [gradle](http://www.gradle.org) as build system. Since the gradle wrapper in included, there is no need to download anything beforehand.

There are three distinct ways to install neo4j-csv-firehose:

* directly inside Neo4j server as unmanaged extension
* as external server with undertow
* as URLStreamHandler hooking directly into to JVM

. In case you're Neo4j server requires authentication ( check for `dbms.security.auth_enabled` in `neo4j-server.properties`) you have to use neo4j-csv-firehose as separate server. If you run Neo4j in embedded mode, also go with separate server deployment here. In all other cases deployment as unmanaged extension is the recommended way to go.

### Installation within a Neo4j server instance (unmanaged extension)

To build the project just type:

    ./gradlew jar

Copy (or symlink) the resulting file `./build/libs/neo4j-csv-firehose-0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar` to Neo4j's `plugins` folder.

Copy any JDBC driver jar files for your relational databases into the `plugins` folder as well. E.g. for mysql use http://central.maven.org/maven2/mysql/mysql-connector-java/5.1.36/mysql-connector-java-5.1.36.jar.

Change configuration in `$NEO4J/conf/neo4j-server.properties`:

    org.neo4j.server.thirdparty_jaxrs_classes=org.neo4j.extension.firehose=/csv

After a restart using `$NEO4J_HOME/bin/neo4j restart` the extensions are active.

### Installation as a separate server

Under the hoods a undertow server with jaxrs support is start. Before running the server be sure to add your jdbc drivers to the runtime dependencies of `build.gradle`. To start up the server:

     ./gradlew run

This starts up the server on localhost:8080.

### Installation as URLStreamHandler

CAUTION: the current implementation of Cypher and `LOAD CSV` explicitly filters for url types. This approach will only work if https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j/pull/5321 gets merged - which might happen for 2.3. In other words: this variant will not work with Neo4j <= 2.2.x

Type

    ./gradlew jar

to build and copy (or symlink) the resulting file `./build/libs/neo4j-csv-firehose-0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar` to Neo4j's `plugins` folder.

In `neo4j-wrapper.conf` configure URL handlers:

     wrapper.java.additional=-Djava.protocol.handler.pkgs=org.neo4j.extension.firehose

and restart Neo4j.

## Usage

A new REST endpoint for rendering JDBC datasource as csv is added:

     http://localhost:7474/csv/jdbc?parameter1=value1&parameter2=value2....

For separate server deployment the URL is (hint `csv` is omitted):

     http://localhost:8080/jdbc?parameter1=value1&parameter2=value2....

For URLStreamHandler style deployment the URLs look like

     jdbc:mysql://localhost/mydb?parameter=value&...

The following query parameters are available - remember to use proper url encoding for their values:

|===
| parameter name | description | mandatory

| url      | the jdbc connection string, syntax depends on your jdbc driver, e.g. `jdbc:mysql://localhost/mydb` | yes, not used for URLStreamHandler variant
| user     | database login for jdbc connection | no
| password | database password for jdbc connection | no
| table    | name of the database table to convert to csv. All columns and rows are used | either `table` or `sql`
| sql      | a sql statement to be rendered to csv | either `table` or `sql`
|===

This endpoint can then be used to run LOAD CSV in Cypher. We assume having a mysql database on localhost, dbname is `mydb`, credentials are `mydb:123`. We want to import from table `person` which has 2 columns: `lastName` and `firstName`. Using the following Cypher statement hits directly the mysql database and creates a node for each person. Here's the version for running via unmanaged extensions:

    neo4j-sh (?)$ load csv with headers from "http://localhost:7474/csv/jdbc?url=jdbc%3Amysql%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%2Fmydb&table=person&user=mydb&password=123" as line create (:Person {firstname: line.firstName, lastname: line.lastName});
    +-------------------+
    | No data returned. |
    +-------------------+
    Nodes created: 2142
    Properties set: 4284
    Labels added: 2142
    1422 ms

When running as separate server use:

    neo4j-sh (?)$ load csv with headers from "http://localhost:8080/jdbc?url=jdbc%3Amysql%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%2Fmydb&table=person&user=mydb&password=123" as line create (:Person {firstname: line.firstName, lastname: line.lastName});

## known gotchas

WARNING: Running inside a Neo4j server (unamanaged extension) works only if the server has authentication disabled. In neo4j-server.properties set:

    dbms.security.auth_enabled=false
